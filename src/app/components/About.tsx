            My first contact with programming was in early 2020 with the development of digital games in the Java language. In fact, I did not like it very much, so at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 I went to full-stack web development in PHP where I had contact with HTML, CSS, Javascript, databases and of course, PHP. 2022 I had to take a short break from studying and enter the job market not related to technology... I worked with Administration for a year. In 2023 I started working in a hotel as Room Service and continued studying Front end. Currently, my main point is the front end because I identified with it more and soon I intend to migrate to the back end becoming a full-stack programmer. I believe that a programmer has to have both sides of the coin with an understanding of the front and back. Working at the Hotel as Room Service I am looking for an opportunity to show my work and migrate to the world of technology
